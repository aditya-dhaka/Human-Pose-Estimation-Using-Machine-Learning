# Human-Pose-Estimation-Using-Machine-Learning

This repository provides an implementation of Human Pose Estimation using machine learning. The goal of this project is to detect and predict the key body joints and their spatial relationships within images or video frames, enabling various applications such as healthcare, fitness tracking, human-computer interaction, and more.

Project Overview

Human Pose Estimation refers to the process of detecting human figures within images and videos and identifying key body parts like the head, shoulders, elbows, wrists, hips, knees, and ankles. This project leverages machine learning algorithms to perform pose detection on static images and dynamic video feeds.

This implementation is built using popular machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The model is trained on benchmark datasets and optimized for real-time performance, making it suitable for a wide variety of applications, such as action recognition, motion analysis, and augmented reality.

Features-

1. Pose Estimation: Detects human body keypoints (e.g., joints, limbs).
2. Real-Time Performance: Supports real-time video pose estimation.
3. Cross-Platform Compatibility: Built to run on both CPU and GPU systems.
4. Simple API: Provides an easy-to-use command-line interface for image and video input.

To run this project, you will need the following installed:

1. Python (>= 3.7)
2. pip (Python package manager)
3. TensorFlow or PyTorch (choose based on your preference)
4. OpenCV (for video processing)

Input Format

The model accepts both individual images and video files as input. Supported formats for images include .jpg, .png, and .bmp. For video files, the model supports .mp4, .avi, and .mov formats.

Results

Below are some sample outputs of the pose estimation process:
